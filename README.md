Lung Cancer Prediction
Presented by:
Luis Valenzuela
We selected covid-19 data as our first topic for this project, that's why our pre-analysis and research was submitted on covid-19. Due to unfortunate hurdles with data we pivoted toward lung cancer prediction analysis.

Project presented in class on December 9, 2022.
