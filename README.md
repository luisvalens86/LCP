Lung Cancer Prediction
Presented by:
Luis Valenzuela
We selected covid-19 data as our first topic for this project, that's why our pre-analysis and research was submitted on covid-19. Due to unfortunate hurdles with data we pivoted toward lung cancer prediction analysis.

Project presented in class on December 9, 2022.

“Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. Your lungs are two spongy organs in your chest that take in oxygen when you inhale and release carbon dioxide when you exhale.” – MayoClinic
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.
The effectiveness of the cancer prediction system helps people to know their cancer risk at a low cost and it also helps the people to take the appropriate decision based on their cancer risk status.
 The data is collected from the website online lung cancer prediction system
